This program simulates projectile motion using a small pygame window that allows you to shoot a ball around the screen.

You can watch my video tutorials on how to create this here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gDOz7E6HVM

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

# Run Instructions
Run the file *projectile_motion.py* to start the program.

# Run in Gitpod

You can also run Projectile-Motion-Physics-Engine in Gitpod, a free online dev environment for GitHub:
